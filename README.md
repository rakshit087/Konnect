# 🌏 Konnect - A full stack Social Media 
A lot of times we want to connect to small communities in our Universities or certain people who are good at something who are available in our University, sometimes we want to share something to the administration or faculties but are concerned about their reactions. On traditional social media, it’s very hard to do so. That’s where Konnect fits in. It’s a social media which is built for Universities and Colleges. It aims at connecting all the students and faculties of an Institute and maintain a separate and parallel database for them. 
I had used MEVN stack to build it from scratch.  

## 💻 Tech Stack Used

🔹 I had used Vue to create the front end of the Project, Axios to make HTTP requests and connect to Backend, VUEX for State Management and save tokens, Vue Router to manage the Front End routes, Tailwind CSS as a CSS utility and we also used SASS as a Post Formatting Language.

🔹 For backend we used Express to create Server and handle the requests and to create API, Mongodb as a No SQL database along with Mongoose as an API.

🔹 For Authentication we use Json Web tokens and bcrypt to hash and salt the passwords.

## 🔧 Installation

🔹 Clone the repo, you will get the server and client folders.

🔹 Open/cd both of these folders and run `npm install` in both of them

🔹 Now in the `client` side run `npm run serve`, it will host the client locally.

🔹 In the server side

## 💡 Features

🔹 You can signup/login and logout, the I had used JWT Web tokens for authentication.

🔹 You can post your thoughts.

🔹 You can upvote and downvote someone else's posts and comment on them.

# 🐛 Bugs and Future Work

The project is under development and there are a lot of things I want to implement and it is far from reaching it's goal, but due to University Exams the project development is kept at halt.
Things I want to Implement - 

🔹 Make it responsive

🔹 Add Profile Pictures.

🔹 Allow users to sort posts by popularity and timings.

🔹 Allow users to follow/unfollow other users

🔹 Work on sections like explore where random posts will show up

🔹 Create a Dashboard kind of thing in the Buzz Section which will provide sentiment analysis of the entire social media and the trending buzz words, this is the only section that can be viewed by faculties and Admin of University.

The last feature was the reason and motivation behind this project. I wanted to create a way which bridges gap between Students and Faculties and provide a way to give anonymous feedback. 
I will start working on the project as soon as my end sem are over
